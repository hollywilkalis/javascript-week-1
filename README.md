## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Planning

1. Specs
  * Take a person's age in years and convert it to seconds.
  * Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds.
  * Return the age of a human in Mercury years.
  * Return the age of a human in Venus years.
  * Return the age of a human in Mars years.
  * Return the age of a human in Jupiter years.
  * Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet.

2. Project organization
  * Divide script into user interface (controls user input form) and back end (performs the various age calculations)
  * Use Human object constructor and prototypes to calculate age on each planet.

3. UX/UI
  * Use bootstrap & CSS for minimal styling of single page (not planning to use SASS).
